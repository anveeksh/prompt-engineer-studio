# Prompt Engineer Studio

Prompt Engineer Studio is a professional web application that transforms rough, unclear user requests into detailed, business-ready prompts for AI tools.

## Why I Created This Software

I built this software to solve a practical problem: most people know what they want, but they struggle to write clear prompts with proper structure, scope, and requirements.

In client and business environments, low-quality prompts lead to low-quality AI output, rework, and confusion. This tool helps convert a basic idea into a clear execution prompt that teams can actually use.

## What Is the Use of This Software?

This software is useful for:

- Prompt engineers who need consistent, high-quality prompts.
- Founders and business owners who want to convert ideas into clear project briefs.
- Agencies and freelancers preparing professional client-facing requirements.
- Product teams that need structured AI-assisted planning.

## Core Benefits

- Converts rough text into structured professional prompts.
- Captures business context (industry, audience, goals, constraints).
- Produces clear sections for strategy, requirements, implementation, and QA.
- Improves output quality and reduces repeated back-and-forth.
- Supports one-click copy and `.txt` export.
